# ProgrammingChallenges
A Collection of few simple programming challenges.

Below is a list of simple projects with their description.

Challenges: 
 - GraphBFS : breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. I used ready abstract class (MGraph). Bfs algorithm is implemented in BFSGraph2 class, also 
              in the same class the shortest path is being counted from a given vertex to the second one given vertex. Rest of the classes 
              are used to create edges, vertex and to write the graph in matrix form. The results are printed on the console.
